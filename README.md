###Take Away
This application was primarily completed to familarize myself with powerful modules like lodash and yargs.

It was great practice to gain knowledge using the ES6 syntax.

This also was my first use of node-inspector, which is a great dedugging tool that provides an excellent GUI for debugging in Chrome.
